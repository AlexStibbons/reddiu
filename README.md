## What's reddiu?

It's more like Reddit's long lost third cousin twice removed than it is a Reddit clone.

The main reason for reddiu's existence is my expanding a project (more specifically, a bulletin board project) to include the most I can from the materials I learnt from. 

So, on the backend side there are one to many and many to many relations, searches that return lists of DTOs and present them in a page DTO (sadly, I did not use a Page or PagedListHolder to handle DTOs in this particular project), CRUD functionalities for every post and every comment, along with a way of up and downvoting. On the frontend side, my main concern is that everything works rather than it looks pretty (at least for now).


## To Dos:

### Current Functionalities

* add edit comment to frontend

* add filtering posts by category to backend + frontend

### Reddit API

* display a random subreddit? or search for subreddits and display the first 3 posts? or something anyway

### Private Groups

* add group option in backend

* add groups in frontend

* add join group to backend + frontend

* add post to group in backend + frontend

* limit group visibility in backend + frontend

### Optional

* link user profile to username

* fix delete comment button

* edit-in-place instead of edit form

* can up/downvoting be neater frontend-side? works fine, but is a bit messy

* fix package names in backend

### Bootstrap

* styling
